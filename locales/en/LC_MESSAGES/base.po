"By default, rewards for group tasks will be divided by the number "

"be 1,666 🧪s (5000/3).\n"
"However, if the group does not collectively wish to distribute the award "

"Absolutely. We do encourage individuality in your writing, however. Simply "
"citing another Alchemist’s work is also **not allowed**.\n"
"Furthermore, where the duplication of tasks is not allowed is translations "

"There is a set budget of Potion🧪s determined before each season. As a "

"each Ambassador in the Season participated equally.\n"
"We encourage each alchemist to complete enough tasks to reach this "
"individual cap. Note, once you have hit the individual cap, you cannot earn "
"more  Potion🧪s  for that season unless an exception is made by The Council. "
"However, this cap will be reset at the beginning of each season. Once the "
"pool cap is reached for a Season there are no more tasks that will reward  "
"Potion🧪s for Alchemists Ambassadors in that Season until the next Season "
"begins. We do not anticipate this happening regularly or for there to be a "
"significant gap between Seasons."

"These tasks are designed this way to encourage collaboration. Many of the "

"amount for the 2 week season is 3,000 🧪s. In this case, a team of 2 could "
